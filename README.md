Data analytics case study for "Cyclistic" - bike share company.

Introduction to Scenario:

I am junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago.
The director of marketing believes the company’s future success
depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to
understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these
insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual
members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be
backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

About the company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown
to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations
across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station
in the system anytime.
Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to
broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the
flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.
Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders.
Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable
than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers,
Marketing director believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth.
Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes
there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders
are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Marketing director has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into
annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how
annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how
digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in
analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

The business task in this case is to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. This understanding will help Cyclistic design a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. 
The goal is to maximize the number of annual memberships, as it has been identified that annual members are much more profitable for Cyclistic compared to casual riders.

To achieve this task, the marketing analytics team needs to analyze the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends and differences in usage patterns between annual members and casual riders. The insights gained from this analysis will be used to inform the design of the new marketing strategy.

Key stakeholders involved in this task include:

Lily Moreno (Director of Marketing): Responsible for the development of marketing campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.
Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team: Responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data to guide Cyclistic's marketing strategy.
Cyclistic Executive Team: Responsible for approving the recommended marketing program based on compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.
In summary, the business task is to analyze the differences in bike usage patterns between annual members and casual riders and use these insights to design a new marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members, with the ultimate goal of maximizing annual memberships for Cyclistic.
